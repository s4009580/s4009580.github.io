<h1> Interactive Experience Research Project </h1>
<span class="brmedium"></span>
<div class="inner"> <p> <u>1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience? </u>
    The experience opens with asking you to change the size of your browser to see the “sun rise”. Along with that, there is a beautiful, harmonised colour, landscape and a helicopter overlooking the pink sunset on the dock with palm trees framing as a silhouette. The visuals were the first thing I noticed upon opening the site. 
    </p></div>

    <div class="innerr"> <p><b> <u>2) Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</u>
        <span class="br"></span> - Reading the text “resize your browser”, I follow the instructions to achieve progression
        <span class="br"></span>- Making the browser as small in width as possible, I proceed clicking “start”.
        <span class="br"></span>- Skimming through the tutorial, I mainly picked up:
        <span class="br"></span>- click and drag scrollbar at bottom to progress
        <span class="br"></span> - click and drag mouse to move around the frame
        <span class="br"></span> - click and hold to immerse in audio experience
        <span class="br"></span> (later on, I realise you should be looking out for the special interactive feature + utilising the poetic interlude)
        <span class="br"></span> - I click and drag around the experience, using the scroller to progress
        
        </p></div>

        <div class="inner"> <p><u>3) What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</u>
            <span class="br"></span> I spent the most time clicking and dragging to observe the space. The site and experience is very visually inclined, the way the textures are a bit grainy and the colours are so vivid to depict a certain retro-esque VHS aesthetic. Additionally,  holding the mouse down to hear diegetic and calming summer sounds was also engaged with a lot. 
            
            </p></div>

            <div class="innerrr"> <p> <u>4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</u>
                The click and drag, looking around and observing the colours and the atmosphere of the environment. 
                </p></div>

                <div class="inner"> <p> <u>5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</u>
                    Very highly impressed! The interaction gave clear and very simple instructions. The website simply felt like immersion, bringing users into the experience of summer with the use of calming music, beautiful and simple colours and shapes to tell the story, the candid and diegetic sound coming from the sources expected. 
                    
                </p></div>

                <div class="innerrrr"> <p> 6) How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
                    From the very start, the text asks users to change the size of the browser to “see the sun rise”, evoking initial confusion but the atmospheric setup makes it very easy to achieve this goal. The typeface is sans serif and white to be easily read against the background, buttons have a frosted glass look to communicate they are clickable, the scroller is placed well in the way it does not distract from the main experience but as a net to users to perform something once they’re don and the transitions of the time periods (e.g the archipelago, the beach) break up the experience and communicate that another location will be presented. The steps needed to achieve the goal are also very linear, keeping it easy to follow and make an overall very easily digestible time. 
                    
                </p></div>

                <div class="innerrrrr"> <p> 7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
                    The experience should be interacted with as long of a duration as users would like. There is no rush to move forward, only based on the patience of a user and the willingness to stay in the summer moment. The introduction even instructs users to give time and immerse themselves. This experience could be played over multiple times as some subtle features may be missed or if users took the time to explore every time stamp in detail then just once would suffice. 
                    
                </p></div>

                <div class="inner"> <p> 8) How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?
                    It communicates how the experience should run with the tutorial. It shows the user ~5 steps and the rest of the experience flows very smoothly. There are no other distractions, and there is opportunity to go backwards within the designated area. 
                    
                </p></div>

                <div class="inner"> <p> 9) What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?
                    This experience also presents strong sound design, in the way it makes the experience feel so natural with high quality sounds and knowledge of sound sources.
                    There is also strong illustration, sense of composition and animation to keep the scenery mobile. 
                    
                </p></div>


                <div class="inner"> <p> 10) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?
                    With all forms of media combined, the simplistic style, the minimalist design in the functions, it keeps users in a low energy state and from the tutorial, the simple actions speak for themselves. 
                    
                </p></div>

                <div class="innerrrrr"> <p> 11) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?
                    It creates a very calm atmosphere. Along with the text dialogue directing users to take their time, the atmospheric setup keeps everything slow paced. There is no urgency in this site and more an invitation to enjoy to each their own. From the way people are basking in the sun, to playing in the water, to being in a record store at night, the world within moves self-paced and encourages users to too.
                    
                </p></div>

                <div class="innerrrrr"> <p> 12) What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?
                    In terms of interacting, there is not much to be frustrated with. It would be nice to be able to interact in full screen mode albeit, that lessens the impact of being able to click and drag to look around the environment, but it breaks the immersion just a little bit when the desktop behind can be seen. This interactive site, however, is very successful on mobile.
                    
                </p></div>

                <div class="inner"> <p> 13) What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?
                    The entire interaction is incredibly satisfying. Everything is so aesthetically tied, making it very easy on the eyes, the music and sound design captures the summer days very well and the mouse functions that enhance the immersion. The purpose of the site has been framed and executed well.
