<h1> Interactive Experience Research Project </h1>
<span class="brmedium"></span>
<div class="inner"> <p><b>1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience? </b>
    The experience opens with asking you to change the size of your browser to see the “sun rise”. Along with that, there is a beautiful, harmonised colour, landscape and a helicopter overlooking the pink sunset on the dock with palm trees framing as a silhouette. The visuals were the first thing I noticed upon opening the site. 
    </p></div>

    <div class="innerr"> <p><b> 2) Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.
        Reading the text “resize your browser”, I follow the instructions to achieve progression
        Making the browser as small in width as possible, I proceed clicking “start”.
        Skimming through the tutorial, I mainly picked up:
        - click and drag scrollbar at bottom to progress
        - click and drag mouse to move around the frame
        - click and hold to immerse in audio experience
        (later on, I realise you should be looking out for the special interactive feature + utilising the poetic interlude)
        I click and drag around the experience, using the scroller to progress
